    "### Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Algorithm\n",
    "- Monte Carlo tree search is a heuristic search algorithm that relies on intelligent tree search to make decisions. Itâ€™s most often used to perform game simulations, but it can also be utilized in cybersecurity, robotics and text generation.\n",
    "- It is a method that relies on intelligent tree search that balances exploration and exploitation. It performs random sampling in the form of simulations and stores the statistics of actions to make more educated choices in each subsequent iteration.\n",
    "- Monte Carlo tree search only searches a few layers deep into the tree and prioritizes which parts of the tree to explore. It then simulates the outcome rather than exhaustively expanding the search space. In doing so, it limits how many evaluations it has to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "### MCTS Algorithm Steps\n",
    "- <b>Selection:</b> Starting at the root node (the current game state), navigate the tree downward by selecting the most promising child node based on an exploration-exploitation trade-off metric (e.g., Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees (UCT)).\n",
    "- <b>Expansion:</b> If a non-leaf node with unvisited children is encountered, randomly expand one child by simulating a legal move for the current player.\n",
    "- <b>Simulation:</b> Play out the game randomly from the newly expanded node until a terminal state (win, loss, or draw) is reached.\n",
    "- <b>Backpropagation</b>: Update the statistics of all nodes traversed back to the root node based on the simulation outcome (reward for winning, penalty for losing, neutral value for a draw).\n",

    "Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a classic two-player, zero-sum game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with their symbol (X or O). The first player to achieve a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol wins. If the board fills without a winner, it's a draw.\n",
